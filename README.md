# React Gallery

## Description

In the React Gallery, the user will see a set of photos on the page, that have a like button that will allow the user to like the photos. Additionally, clicking on the photo itself will bring up a description of the photos. Clicking the description will be replaced by the photo again.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

There is no database component to base mode. All data is stored in an array on the server. Before you get started, add a few images to the public/images folder and modify the server/modules/data.js to include an id, title, description and path for each of your images. Each id should be a unique number (e.g. 1, 2, 3...).

1. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
2. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
3. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
4. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
